/**
 * Paper tooth, as a data URI.

 * `fractalNoise` at a high base frequency and desaturated to grey: under
 * `overlay` a mid-grey pixel leaves the surface untouched and only the
 * deviations read, which is what lets one tile sit over both the cream and the
 * ink without tinting either. `stitchTiles` keeps the 180px repeat from
 * showing its seams.
 *
 * Two corrections keep it from lifting the page a shade lighter instead of
 * texturing it, both aimed at landing the tile's mean on neutral grey — the
 * value `overlay` passes through untouched:
 *
 *   · the alpha channel is flattened to 1. feTurbulence randomises all four
 *     channels, and compositing half-transparent noise raises the mean rather
 *     than scattering around it.
 *   · `color-interpolation-filters` is forced to sRGB. Filters default to
 *     linearRGB, and converting that result back for display pulled the mean
 *     luma up to 187 of 255 — a permanent wash over every surface on the page.
 *
 * It does not animate. Film grain crawls; paper grain doesn't, and this page is
 * pretending to be printed. It also means the topmost full-viewport layer on
 * the page repaints exactly never.
